    <h1 style="font-family: Impact; Color: Purple">How I came to Weber State</h1>
    <p style="color: Black">I was referred to Weber State by a friend from High School who came here to study physics. I wasn't sure where I wanted to go to college at the time,<br> so she reccomended that I give Weber a try. I signed up for classes in Spring of 2017 and it has been a wild ride ever since.</br></p>
